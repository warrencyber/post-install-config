 <br /> 
Roles are the permissions granted to Agents per Department that they have access to. Each Role has a set of permissions that can be checked/unchecked for agents given that Role in association with a Department they have access. An unlimited number of roles can be created and assigned to Agents with access to various departments.
    <ol>
  <li>Admin Panel -> Agents -> Roles</li>
  <li>Supreme Admin</li>
    </ol>

      <br />
Agents are given access to the help desk with the intent to respond and resolve the tickets. When adding an Agent to the help desk, they will need to be assigned to a Primary Department and given a Primary Role for the Tickets/Tasks routed to that department. Agents can be given Extended Access to additional departments of the help desk as well as assigned different Roles to those departments; this can be configured in the Access tab of the Agentâ€™s Profile.
